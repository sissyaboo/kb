# Frequently Asked Question

## Why does your English sound so weird?
I never learned it properly, like from an actual teacher, school, or course. My main source of language knowledge was Cartoon Network. This is also one of my goals: I want to stream and engage with users to improve. So if you spot a mistake or if I say something ridiculously wrong, please point it out. Let me have it! :-)

## Why now? A sissy? You old fuck!
Did you watch that cop show, "The Rookie"? If not, I recommend it. It's a great show! Getting back to the point, I'm nowhere near being that old. At the same time, I wanted to change my life and start living true to myself. Believing in my instincts, doing what I like, creating the content I've always wanted, or getting into adult entertainment, as I think that part of the internet is crazy overlooked and stigmatized. 

## Why donâ€™t you want to reveal your face? Coward?!
It's a part of something that I want to accomplish. Sissy Aboo isn't only an act, it's me. It encompasses my hobbies, interests, feelings, and everything I live by. However, I do not want to limit my face and personal brand to just one thing or something I'm into. Look at Ziggy Stardust, deadmau5, or any other examples. I'm sure you must know at least one artist you like who has a mask or a full-fledged persona that they're into. And I do too. With that in mind, I want to introduce different characters that fulfill various roles, but I need to start somewhere.

Also, privacy is important to me. I would like to keep my private life private.

## What did you do before this?
I was responsible for managing teams from ad sales to software development. When I started, the Twin Towers were still standing, so one can say that I have some experience. I'm not an expert in any of the things I have done or will be doing, by any means. Plenty of those are new to me, but I'm a nerd. I grew up learning everything by myself, so I'm eager to learn new things!

## Why so many platforms?
For many reasons, but most importantly, I want to do a lot of things, and not all of them include NSFW content. I will do a lot of crafting/coding/commentary/IRL streaming on Twitch. Scrolling through social media, playing games, or doing something related to a project. Crafting masks, maybe? Coding a new open-source project? I have a lot of things in mind. These are projects that will be built upon engagement and support from users on less adult-oriented platforms like YouTube or Patreon, at the same time bringing joy to everyone.

Same goes for adult content, I have categorized content types I want to do, and attached them to specific platforms. As each one of them attracts different kind of viewers and engagement. For that kind of content go to [https://kb.sissyaboo.com](https://kb.sissyaboo.com) open knowledge site.

## Open Knowledge Site? What in the hell?!
Yes, a place for me to store things I learned along the way. There are a lot of articles detailing how to do certain things, but they are scattered across the web. I will use this place to consolidate that knowledge. You can expect stuff like gear and software setup, how-tos, guides, verification processes, social media assets and templates, and many more.

## Anything other idea?
Oh, don't mind, I do! I have a lot of them actually, but ideas are just that. They do not bring any emotions, and something that works and brings joy to people is way different than just an idea. I plan a lot of things, but we'll see how I get on with everything.
